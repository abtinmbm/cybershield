## APIs and Libraries
CyberShield leverages several APIs and libraries to enhance its functionality:
- **jQuery**: Used for DOM manipulation and handling AJAX requests for dynamic content updates.
- **Fuse.js**: Provides efficient search functionality within the forum.
- **Django REST Framework**: Utilized for creating APIs to handle data interactions between the frontend and backend.

## Authentication
CyberShield uses Django's built-in authentication system to manage user registration, login, and permissions. This ensures secure access to the forum's features and protects user data.

## Future Growth and Technical Development Goals
- **Scalability**: Implementing load balancing and database optimization to handle increased traffic.
- **Enhanced Security**: Adding features like two-factor authentication and advanced user activity monitoring.
- **Mobile App**: Developing a mobile application to provide a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets.
- **Community Features**: Introducing features like user badges, reputation points, and private messaging to foster community engagement.

## Tech Stack Explanation
- **Django**: Chosen for its robust framework and ease of use in building secure web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easy to create responsive and modern designs.
